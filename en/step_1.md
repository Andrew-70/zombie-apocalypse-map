## Introduction

Create a real map of your local area and mark on it the locations of supplies, secret bases and even the zombies themselves!

### What you will make

Add something here to showcase here, for example:

<div class="scratch-preview">
  <iframe allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/embed/160619869/?autostart=false" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>

Add instructions here. These should explain either how the finished project will work, or explain how to interact with the content above.

### What you will learn

You will learn how to display a Google map on a web page, how to add an icon to the map when you click on a location and how to add a description of each location.

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum):
