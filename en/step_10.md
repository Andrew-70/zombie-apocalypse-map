## Challenge: Prepare for zombies

+ Change the map so it is centered on your local area instead of on Cambridge, UK
+ Add your own points of interest to the zombie map
+ Copy and paste your location data from the console log into a text file (be careful to remove any other data that might have been included too such as filenames and line numbers) so that we can use it to create a [GPS zombie map]()
